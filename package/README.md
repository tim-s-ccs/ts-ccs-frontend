# CCS Components

CCS Components contains the code you need to start building a user interface
for CCS platforms and services.

This is based off of [GOV.UK Frontend](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend) which was created and is maintained by a team at the Government Digital Service.

Because of this, CCS Components can be used in an identical way to GOV.UK Frontend.

As part of future work, there will be a place where you can view live examples and guidance on when to use CCS Components as part of your service.

## STATUS: BUILD AND DEVELOPMENT
At the moment this project is still in the build and development phase.

As it is still not decided if CCS wants to take on this project, it is being hosted on the personal accounts of `tim-s-ccs`.

That is why the package is called [`ts-ccs-component` on NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-ccs-components).

This will all be updated, with real package name confirmed, before the first major release.

## Contact the team

CCS Components is maintained by a team at the Crown Commercial Service.

If you want to know more about CCS Components, please email [Tim South](mailto:timothy.south@crowncommercial.gov.uk)

## Quick start

Please note that this package is designed to be used in the same way as GOV.UK Frontend so if these documents are not sufficient, please try the [documentation for GOV.UK Frontend](https://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/).

There are 2 ways to start using CCS Components in your app.

### 1. Install with npm (recommended)

We recommend [installing CCS Components using node package manager (npm)](docs/instillation/install-with-npm.md).

### 2. Install using compiled files

You can also install CCS Components by [copying our CSS, JavaScript and asset files into your project](docs/instillation/install-using-compiled-files.md).

## Importing styles, JavaScripts and assets

### Before you start
GOV.UK Frontend is a dependency of CCS Components.
Therefore, boefore you import the styles, JavaScripts and assets CCS Components, you need to impor them for GOV.UK Frontend first.

You can do this by following the steps on the [Design System site](https://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/get-started/#get-started)

### Importing styles

You need to import the CCS Components styles into the main Sass file in your project.
You should place the below code before your own Sass rules (or Sass imports) if you want to override CCS Components with your own styles.

To import add the below to your Sass file:

  ```scss
  @import "node_modules/ts-ccs-components/ccs/all";
  ```

[More details on importing styles](https://github.com/tim-s-ccs/tim-ccs-components/blob/main/docs/guides/import-assets.md#css)

### Importing JavaScript

Some of the JavaScript included in CCS Components improves the usability and accessibility of the components.
You should make sure that you are importing and initialising Javascript in your application to ensure that all users can use it successfully.

You can include Javascript for all components either by copying the `all.js` from `node_modules//ts-ccs-components/ccs/` into your application or referencing the file directly:

```html
<script src="<path-to-ccs-components-all-file>/all.js"></script>
```
Next you need to initialise the script by adding:

```html
<script>window.CCSComponents.initAll()</script>
```

[More details on importing Javascript and advanced options](https://github.com/tim-s-ccs/tim-ccs-components/blob/main/docs/guides/import-assets.md#javascript)


### Importing assets

In order to import CCS Components images to your project, you should configure your application to reference or copy the relevant CCS Components assets.

[More details on importing assets](https://github.com/tim-s-ccs/tim-ccs-components/blob/main/docs/guides/import-assets.md#image-assets)
