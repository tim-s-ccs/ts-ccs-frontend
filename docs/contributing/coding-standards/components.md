# Components

You can find components in `src/govuk/components`.

## Name your components

Generally, folder and file names should be singular, for example ‘accordion’, ‘backlink’, ‘button’. Only use plural names when the component is usually used in groups, for example ‘breadcrumbs’, ‘checkboxes’, ‘radios’.

## Structure your component folder

When creating your component, you should create the following files in the component’s folder:

      - `README.md`
      - `_[component-name].scss`
      - `_index.scss`
      - `[component-name].yaml`
      - `macro.njk`
      - `template.njk`
      - `template.test.js`

If your component uses JavaScript, you must also create the following files in the component’s folder:

      - `_[component-name].js`
      - `_[component-name].test.js`
